                    If you're looking for an exhilarating adventure during your stay at our resort, why not try paragliding? Before taking to the skies, there are a few important things to keep in mind. Firstly, all paragliding flights are weather dependent, so it's important to check with our staff for the latest weather conditions and to book your flight in advance. We offer tandem paragliding flights with experienced pilots, so no previous experience is necessary. You'll be given a full safety briefing and instruction on takeoff and landing procedures before your flight. Wear comfortable clothing and closed-toe shoes, and bring a jacket as it can be cooler at higher altitudes. Don't forget to bring a camera to capture the stunning views from above! During your flight, sit back and enjoy the experience, and feel free to ask your pilot any questions you may have. Paragliding is an exciting way to see the beautiful scenery around our resort, but safety is our top priority. All of our equipment is regularly inspected and maintained, and our pilots are trained and experienced. If you have any concerns or questions, don't hesitate to ask our staff. Get ready for an unforgettable paragliding adventure!
